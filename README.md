# Cybersecurity-day-6

---

## Objective:
  - To understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools

## Tools:
  - https://password.kaspersky.com/
  - https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
  - https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/

## Steps:
1. Create Multiple Passwords
  - Make 5–6 passwords with different complexity levels:
  - Simple (e.g., 123456, abcdef, ABCDEF)
  - Medium (e.g., hello2025h, doggy1998p, house2001)
  - Complex (e.g., H3ll0@Secure!2025, Pu9py@25#19,  Fam!ly#45@56)
  - Long passphrase (e.g., MyDogEatsPizza@9amEveryday, IgoToHome@6pmBy5ABus)
2. Test Passwords
  - Open a password checker tool (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
  - Enter each password and note:
      * Score / Strength level
      * Estimated crack time (e.g., "Instantly", "42 minutes.)
      * Feedback (e.g., "Too short", "Good use of symbols", "Your Password will be cracekd")
3. Record Results
||      Password	      ||   Score (%)  ||      Crack Time	      ||                  Tool Feedback                  ||
  - 123456	         -->       10%	    -->         < 1 second	     -->         Too short, only numbers
  - hello2025	       -->       35%	    -->         A few seconds	   -->       No symbols or uppercase
  - H3ll0@Secure!2025	  -->    95%	    -->         Centuries	       -->       Strong - good mix of all character types
  - MyDogEatsPizza@9am	-->    90%	    -->         Billions of years	 -->     Strong – good length and complexity

## Tips for Strong Passwords
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Include: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols
  - Avoid using personal info (name, birthday)
  - Don’t reuse the same password across sites
  - Use passphrases for easier memorization
